cd employee-management
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
bash
```
npm install
```
### 3. Environment Configuration
#### Development Environment
Update src/environments/environment.ts:

#### For Spring Boot:

typescript
```
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'http://localhost:8080/api'
};
```
#### For ASP.NET Core:

typescript
```
export const environment = {

  apiUrl: '/api'  // Relative URL for same domain deployment
};
```
### 4. Backend Setup
#### Option A: Spring Boot Backend
Ensure your Spring Boot application is running on http://localhost:8080

Database should be running and accessible

Verify API endpoints are available at /api/employees and /api/departments

#### Option B: ASP.NET Core Backend
Ensure your ASP.NET Core application is running on https://localhost:7000

Database should be configured and running

Verify API endpoints are available at /api/employees and /api/departments

### 5. Development Proxy (Optional)
For development with CORS issues, use the proxy configuration in proxy.conf.json:
json
```
{
  "/api": {
    "target": "http://localhost:8080",
    "secure": false,
    "changeOrigin": true
  }
}
```
